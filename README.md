> Cookbooks Should be Hackable

## What is git-cooking?
#### Developers can be picky eaters. `git-cooking` aims to be the programmer's cookbook.

`git-cooking` is a repository of (mostly) open-format recipies created and augmented by
the GitHub community. It aims to provide a database of easily-accesible meal ideas to
both the developer community and general population. By utilising the JSON format for the
design of comestible recipes, `git-cooking` aims to be an open database of easily-parsable
cullinary formulas.

## Structure
`git-cooking` separates recipes into three primay segments:

| Directory | Type                                                |
| --------- |:----:                                               |
| /main     | New recipes created by the GitHub community         |
| /contrib  | Copyleft recipes converted to `git-cooking` JSON    |
| /non-free | Recipes using a non-JSON format or non-free license |

## Format

`git-cooking` is under active development, more will be added to this README shortly...
